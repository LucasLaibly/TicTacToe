# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe Flask API

## Objective:
Explore other frameworks that are used to build REST-ful API's. Though Flask is a micro-framework, it boasts a verbose expansion set.
I wanted to make a simple game of Tic Tac Toe using this framework. 

### Goals:
1. Build the game for two people to be able to play
2. Add a computer version in which I implement ```minimax``` function to try and best the human player.

### Intentions:
I hope to become more familiar with Flask and Python as a whole, while being able to make a more simplistic game that will surely be built a million times over.


### Current:
1. Game board created - 11/9/2020
